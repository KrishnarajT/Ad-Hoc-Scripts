You can have secondary intentions, sure, but make sure the primary one is the reason that thing exists. If not, then don't do that thing. And this is a principle we can try to live by ig. It'll result in you doing things naturally, and will make you stand out. Things will automatically fall into place coz you chose the natural path.\\n\\nEg. Learn complex vocabulary to express yourself better. Not to brag over others with language. Sure, it's a plus that it'll sound impressive, do it for that too, but 80% of your reason should be better communication, which is why those words exist. Use them. Learn a language to actually use it in either reading literature of that language, watching it's shows and movies or best to talk to someone in it. Not just to add a new skill to your resume. Learn about operating systems, to better deal with operating systems, or to learn about something that fascinates you, not for clearing Gate. Yeah sure learn for that too, but it'll show when you talk about it. None of these are wrong, but there's a difference in what I prefer. Former will make you stick to natural. Latter will suck the beauty out of it. Sometimes it worth it. Assess the tradeoff. Read a book to enjoy the book not to add reading as a hobby on your intro speech.
